# Surebet Arbitrage Scraper

An Apify Actor that:

âœ… Crawls surebet pages
âœ… Parses sports events and odds using Cheerio
âœ… Calculates surebet allocations and guaranteed profits
âœ… Saves results into an Apify Dataset for easy export (JSON, CSV, XLSX)

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

This actor:

1. Loads HTML pages via Playwright
2. Parses all surebet matches (e.g. Tennis, Football, MMA, etc.)
3. Extracts:
    - Sport
    - Country
    - League
    - Date and time
    - Market (e.g. Home/Away, Over/Under)
    - Team or player names
    - Odds and bookmakers
4. Calculates surebet allocations for **2-way markets**:
    - Stake split
    - Total payout
    - Guaranteed profit
    - Surebet percentage
5. Saves everything as JSON records in an Apify dataset.

## ðŸ›  Configuration

The actor logic lives in:

* `main.ts` â†’ Crawler logic and orchestration
* `surebet.ts` â†’ Calculation of surebet allocations
* `routes.ts` â†’ Request routing

---

## Limitations

* Currently supports **2-way markets** only (Home/Away, Over/Under).
* No handling of 3-way surebets (e.g. 1X2 with Draw) yet.
* No built-in actor input schemaâ€”modify `main.ts` to change URLs or stake amount.

---

## How to Run

Locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Or deploy to Apify and run as an actor.

---

## Data Export

On Apify, download results as:

* JSON
* CSV
* Excel (XLSX)
* NDJSON

Via API:

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/<DATASET_ID>/items?format=json
```
